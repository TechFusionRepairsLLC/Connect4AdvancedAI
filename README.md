I have created a game with advanced AI:

Enhanced AI Intelligence:
Added a sophisticated position evaluator in a separate file
Implemented alpha-beta pruning for better performance
Created different depth levels for each difficulty
Added strategic scoring for center control and potential winning patterns
Added Player Names:
Players can now customize their names in the settings
Computer player name is locked when in single-player mode
Names are displayed during turns and when announcing winners
Improved Code Organization:
Separated evaluation logic into its own module
Enhanced type definitions
Better state management for player names
AI Difficulty Levels:
Easy: Looks 2 moves ahead
Medium: Looks 4 moves ahead
Hard: Looks 6 moves ahead
Each level uses the same smart evaluation but with different depths
The game should now be more challenging and personalized with custom player names. The AI will play more strategically, especially on higher difficulty levels.
